### What is Crypto Ticker?

Crypto Ticker is a very lightweight Chrome extension that allows you to keep track of cryptocurrency prices.

### How do I use it?

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cbmbekgaigkkhplhnmmaloiklobjdeba/), click on the extension icon on your toolbar (or in the dropdown extensions menu), enter a coin's symbol or CoinGecko ID, and click on the "Add" button. Some coins may have the same symbol on CoinGecko's API, in which case you'll have to enter the coin's full name or its CoinGecko ID.
